Without the heart, she feels no pain when she gets hurt; she feels no fear when she faces the reality.\"<br><br>She is Shire, the main character of the book.

            description: "This Eileen Punk never is just one thing. She is a not-yet-artist, not-too-graphic designer, and she's on her way to becoming a very web developer. Ella habla muy bien Spanglish. She's also a typical perfectionist with a positive attitude. Plus! She's funny :P"
