She started it when she was 12 years old. It hasn't been published. Well... not yet, not until it’s well prepared.<br><br>\"The story is about a funeral of the heart. It died in love. She put it in a coffin with a bloody black rose. Without the heart, she feels no pain when she gets hurt; she feels no fear when she faces the reality.\"<br><br>She is <b>Shire</b>, the main character of the book. You will find her all over these paintings. She's the pale girl who always cuts herself with a blade."

She not only writes stories and edit words, she loves everything relates to <b>books</b>.<br><br>To publish books was her dream as a child. Now since she's edited and published some books and magazines, to publish her own story is a <b>dream</b> that hasn't accomplished. And she will never stop chasing it."

Sometimes she plays <b>3D max</b> to render a minimalist packaging project; sometimes plays with papers. That <b>Funeral Invitation Card</b>, she made it for her baby novel \"Funeral\". She's good at making things by hand. She even makes clothes. Most of her clothes have been transformed at least once.<br><br>Don't ever underestimate a <b>lefty</b> and her hands. Her right hand can do what yours can do, and her left one can do what yours probably can't do."
