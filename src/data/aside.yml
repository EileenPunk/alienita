Now she is probably coding, which has become her favorite thing recently. However, most of the time, she’s a writer. She tells her own stories to those who are willing to listen."

It hasn't been published. Well... not yet, not until it’s well prepared.<br><br>\"The story is about a funeral of the heart. It died in love. She put it in a coffin with a bloody black rose. Without the heart, she feels no pain when she gets hurt; she feels no fear when she faces the reality.\"<br><br>She is Shire, the main character of the book. You will find her all over these paintings. She's the pale girl who always cuts herself with a blade."

They are from different countries, different races and religions. They speak different languages and they are at different ages. All the differences, they share one thing in common, they love having fun with each other :P"

                en: "Before she indulged herself in coding, editorial was her favorite thing. She still loves it, but just spends less time with it.<br><br>Why did I say she's a not-too-graphic designer? Because she's more an editor. She not only writes stories and edit words, she loves everything relates to books.<br><br>To publish books was her dream as a child. Now since she's edited and published some books and magazines, to publish her own story is a dream that hasn't accomplished. And she will never stop chasing it."
